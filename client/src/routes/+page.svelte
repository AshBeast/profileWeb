    <h1>Welcome to my confidential space on the web!<span class="emo">ðŸ‘‹</span></h1>
    <h1>My name is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0" class="highlight">Ashkan Zahedanaraki</a></h1>
    <p>I'm a passionate developer and a proud alum of BCIT's Computer Systems Technology diploma program, where I learned programming fundamentals from September 2021 to May 2023. I'm on my journey to earning a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science focusing on network security, which I plan to complete between September 2023 and May 2025.</p>
    
    <p>My coding adventure began in high school at Mount Baker Secondary School, where computer science classes in grades 11 and 12 sparked a flame that turned into a roaring fire of curiosity and creation. I've since dipped my toes in various technologies and programming languages, crafting a diverse portfolio of projects that I'm excited to showcase.</p>
    
    <p>So, take your time, explore, and enjoy the fruits of my labour â€“ each project is a story, and I'm thrilled to have you read mine.</p>
